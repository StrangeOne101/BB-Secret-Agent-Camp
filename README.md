# BB-Secret-Agent-Camp
A repo for the online site used to register for the 2017 Team Section Camp, known as "Secret Agent Camp". The site could be found at https://secretagentcamp.co.nz and was developed in PHP.

This was my first real site I've developed in PHP. It could do the following:

* Get people to sign up
* Store the registrations in a database
* Send an automated email out to the registee confirming their registration (along with payment details, etc)
* Send an automated email to us to say someone registered
* Had a Invisible Google Captcha to prevent bots from filling the database
* Catches any errors apon registration and sends all the info they used to my personal email (along with the error) so I could fix the issue
* Had a live countdown timer to when camp started

This site will be used as a base for next years site. As such, issues I found with the site (along with features for next time) can be found in the issues section.
