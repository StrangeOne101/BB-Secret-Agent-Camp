# BB Team Section Camp
A repo for the online site used to register for the 2017 Team Section Camp, known as "Secret Agent Camp". In 2018 it was updated to be used for "Space Camp" and was developed in PHP.

This was my first real site I've developed in PHP. It could do the following:

* Get people to sign up
* Store the registrations in a database
* Send an automated email out to the registee confirming their registration (along with payment details, etc)
* Send an automated email to us to say someone registered
* Had a Invisible Google Captcha to prevent bots from filling the database
* Catches any errors apon registration and sends all the info they used to my personal email (along with the error) so I could fix the issue
* Had a live countdown timer to when camp started

As of 2018, it also had an administration panel that allowed registered admin users to see all registrations in the database. This came with things such as statistics, redacted long fields, as well as the ability to create URLs which could display a pre-defined SQL query.

This site will be used as a base for next years site in 2019 as well. As such, issues I find within the site (along with features for next time) can be found in the issues section.
