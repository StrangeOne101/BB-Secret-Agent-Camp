    Added Statistics
    <ul>
        <li>Added 3 pie charts to the statistics page</li>
    </ul>
    Modified Database Tables
    <ul>
        <li>Tables now show the most recent ones at the top of the table and are no longer sorted based on type (was too confusing
            to find new entries)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>19/7/18</h5>
    New Data Viewers Page
    <ul>
        <li>Allows you to invite others to view from the database with set queries</li>
        <li>The page itself explains what it is for and how to use it</li>
        <li>Still a Work in Progress. Backend has yet do be done and some front end still needs work.</li>
    </ul>
    New Changelog page (this page)
    <ul><li>Just a more tidy way of keeping track of changes to the panel.</li></ul>
    Misc Changes
    <ul>
        <li>Registrations now filter values such as nil, N/A, none, -, nothing, etc, from medical and dietary fields. This
        means we don't have to go in and edit it ourselves so that the registration doesn't come up in medical/dietary queries.</li>
    </ul>
    Bug Fixes
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed postcodes not being added to addresses in the database. This bug was only introduced recently and only
            affects a few registrations</li>
            <li>Fixed being able to register without a last name</li>
        </ul>
    <h5>18/7/18</h5>
    New Dashboard
    <ul>

        <li>Shows a pie chart of the total registrations</li>
        <li>Shows a line graph of the number of registrations we are getting per day</li>
        <li>All things shown are live and are updated when you refresh the page</li>
    </ul>
    Database Table Improvements
    <ul>
        <li>Database table now checks every 10 minutes if there has been an update to the table, and if there has been, it
            updates itself</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>15/7/18</h5>
    Database Table Improvements
    <ul>
        <li>Table now shortens long pieces of data so the size of the table doesn't overflow. Can be clicked on to show the full
